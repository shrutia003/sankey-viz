"Well worth a try as an alternative browser, its good to see more addons for mobile. Latest update has made youtube videos drop alot of frames,, only thing to fix it is to change the video resolution back and forth everytime watching a new video. This could be a youtube issue, a bit annoying for me as i use/d this browser mainly for youtube. I tried the nightly build about config, changed the force gpu process to true, still no joy",annoying
